The project aims to bridge the gap between Citizen Science initiatives (CSIs) and local authorities, enhancing environmental compliance and monitoring. By strengthening CSIs, facilitating collaboration, and developing tools to validate Citizen-Generated Data (CGD), more4nature seeks to make CGD a key part of the Green Deal Data Space, driving green and digital transformations.</p>",

      "<p>It’s exciting to see the discussion on societal engagement and open science. At more4nature, we're actively contributing to this dialogue by empowering citizens and communities in environmental action. Our project is all about leveraging Citizen Science initiatives (CSIs) to tackle pollution, protect biodiversity, and prevent deforestation.</p><p>Citizen involvement and citizen-generated data (CGD) are vital to counter environmental degradation. That's why more4nature is dedicated to bridging the gap between CSIs and authorities. By strengthening CSIs, facilitating collaboration, and developing tools for validating CGD, we ensure that valuable data doesn't go to waste.</p>",

      '<p>Our team is thrilled to reunite in Copenhagen, advancing transformative conservation efforts by integrating citizens and Sitizen Science initiatives into environmental compliance. Discussions with European Environment Agency (EEA) experts highlighted shared interests in using Citizen-Generated Data for monitoring at national and regional levels.</p> <p>We explored links between health, pollution, and the need for better data on issues like microplastics. More4nature partner Ida Theilade emphasized, "Citizens can play a role because they know what to look for," despite challenges like illegal logging.</p>',

      '<p>At the JRC and ESA Environmental Crimes Workshop 2024, Joan Maso Pau from CREAF presented a poster on "Empowering Citizens in Collaborative Environmental Compliance Assurance." Joan highlighted how more4nature drove conservation by involving citizens and communities in efforts to achieve zero pollution, protect biodiversity, and prevent deforestation. The presentation covered strengthening Citizen Science Initiatives for reliable data, enhancing collaboration between Citizen Science initiatives and authorities, developing tools for validating and integrating citizen data, incorporating data into the Green Deal Data Space, and fostering synergies with LivingLabs and Fab Labs. We engaged with experts and explored how remote sensing could complement citizen science.</p>',

We are grateful to João Loureiro and Sílvia Castro for inviting Cristina from Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa to showcase our work. More4nature collaborated with PolinizAÇÃO in Portugal on citizen science and the Pollinator Action Plan, coordinated by the FLOWer Lab, Centre for Functional Ecology - Science for People & the Planet. We remained committed to empowering communities through citizen science for environmental conservation, zero pollution, biodiversity protection, and deforestation prevention.</p>",

      "<p>Exciting news on the EU's Nature Restoration Law! Portuguese Minister Maria Da Graça Carvalho recently emphasized the importance of protecting pollinators, highlighting the Action Plan led by Universidade de Coimbra and featured in more4nature's case studies. This plan aims to combat pollinator decline through improved conservation efforts, data collection via citizen science, and increased public awareness. PolinizAÇÃO, part of polli.NET and coordinated by the FLOWer Lab, is a key initiative in this effort. Kudos to more4nature partners Cristina Luís and Esther Marín González for their work on this crucial Biodiversity Protection case.</p>",
